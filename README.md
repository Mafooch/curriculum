# Curriculum

Contains articles, challenges, and exercises for use with the [Event Horizon][event-horizon] application.

Right now the file organization is in flux: the **exercises** directory contains the material used by [comet][comet] and the **lessons** directory contains the material used by Event Horizon. Eventually comet exercises will be incorporated into Horizon.
